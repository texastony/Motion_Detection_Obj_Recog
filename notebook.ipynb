    "##### Creating GUI and a Probablistic Background Subtractor\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach I propose for detecting motion in a frame is via probabalistic background subtraction. There are many background subtracting algorithms (OpenCV implements 4), but I think the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) implementation is the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BackGroundSubtractorKNN`, when applied to a frame, produces a mask. I will apply this mask to the frame, and thus produce only the foreground that is interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I setup the camera, background subtractor, and the trackbars. I am going to use the trackbars to play around with the attributes of the background subtractor. The background subtractors in OpenCV have many parameters, but I found these two to be the crux. Checkout the OpenCV reference to learn about the other parameters, or the papers on the background subtraction algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: Much of computer vision is tweaking parameters to different situations. I frequently use setups like the one we are creating here to tune parameters. Different cameras, room lighting, room coloring, and use cases need different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: I initialize an empty matrix to store the product of the mask and the frame. Do stuff like this when you are consistently doing the same operation and you know what the output dimensions are going to be. "

For instance, `history` set to 32 & 400 gives me an average (out of 3 trials each) of 7.372 & 7.645. If your FPS is too slow to detect the motion you are looking for, you can reduce the resolution size of the original frame right after you capture it. Just modify the `resize` code I used above. "
