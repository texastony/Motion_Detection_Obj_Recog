#+STARTUP: overview
# -*- mode: org -*-

This is a demo combining Open-CV functions with Keras to detect
objects. Tensorflow will be used as Keras' backend. 

The intended audience is the intermediate Python programmer, though
the advanced programmer may benefit from the computer-vision and
machine learning aspects of this demo.


* Hardware requirements:

At a minimum, a webcammera and a system at least as powerful as the
Raspberry Pi 3 B are required. 

The project is tested on an early 2011 MacBook Pro (RAM 16GB, SSD
500GB, macOS 10.12.6) and a Raspberry Pi 3 B with 10GB. It is likely
possible to run on lesser hardware or a different OS (if you do, let
me know, I am curious).

* Software requirements 
(in parathesise is the tested version)

** Installed via pip3:
   - Open-CV 3 (3.3.0)
   - Tensorflow 1.3 (1.3.0)
   - Keras 2 (2.0.8)
   - h5py 2 (2.7.1)
   - *Jupyter 1 (1.0.0)* *

 * *Only needed for the notebook*

** Installed via Homebrew or apt-get:
   - Python 3 (3.6.3)
   - HDF5 1.10 (1.10.1_2)
